# The F6 Mod
An extension that I made for Tanks: The Crusades while I was first learning Java and its fundamental concepts.

This extension contains a chaotic mess of at times strangely-implemented obstacles & tanks that may or may not fit well into Tanks.

This git repository has had the original commit history erased. This is because at the time of development I did not know how to use a gitignore and committed a whole Tanks jar file, which is too big for github.

As of right now, this extension is purely in a maintenance-only state. This means I will try to fix bugs that are reported, but I will not be adding any new features (because I have other extensions that need work more than this one).
